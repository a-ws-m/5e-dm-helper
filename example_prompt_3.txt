The ongoing moral crisis among Sharn's citizens. This article is an editorial by
a sneering woman called Mabel Sneaker. She uses the article to lament about how
more and more shipments of the drug called dragonsblood are being seized by the
City Watch, and comments on the fact that most of this illegal substance is
being smuggled in by goblins affiliated with Daask. In the article, she also
speculates about how many of these goblins are in receipt of government
benefits, and on how ridiculous it is that a whole sector of their bustling
city, Khyber's Gate, is unsafe to travel because of the Daask criminal presence
there.
