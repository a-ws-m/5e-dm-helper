The arrival of another wave of Cyran refugees, who are now camped outside of the
gates of the city. They have come from New Cyre, where an epidemic has recently
broken out. Invent a name for this epidemic and include it in the article. The
City Watch have been instructed to strictly control entry to the city to avoid
spreading the disease to its residents. Some people are worried that Dark Six
worshippers may use this mass migration as a cover to enter the city unnoticed;
who knows how many of these foreigners are part of that cult? Include a
statement from House Jorasco, who are working on a cure, which, they reassure
people, will be covered by their latest insurance package.
