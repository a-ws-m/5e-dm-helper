The disappearance of a Brother of the Red Sun Vassals, a religious organisation.
Invent the brother's name. He was last seen around the scene of the recent
terror attack that was unleashed at a protest against the Red Sun Vassal's
inquisition. He was not there to support the protestors, of course, but his
order believe that everyone has a right to freedom of speech and he wanted to
make sure everyone was safe. Include an interview with the man's ten-year-old
daughter, pleading for information leading to his safe return.
